          I am a front-end developer based in Dekhi looking for exciting
          opportunities. Has BTech(CSE) background. Likes to focus on
          accessibility when developing. Passionate and curious about solving
          problems. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring Reactjs and a bit of Designing.
          While I am not programming, I enjoy playing basketball and to read
          about our great histories and learning from ancestors. Learning more
          to improve skill.
